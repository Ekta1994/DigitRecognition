# DigitRecognition


Machine Learning in python is very easy using scikit-learn. Scikit is an open source machine learning library for python. It features various classification, regression and clustering algoritms using support vector machines, naive Bayes etc. 

This project aims at recognising the handwritten digits. We're going to use a pre-existing data set that everyone has which comes with the installation of Scikit-Learn. One of the data sets, digits, contains an already structured and labeled set of samples that contains pixel information for numbers up to 9 that we can use for training and testing.

Installation:
 We'll need the following:
 
 Scikit learn: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-learn/0.15.2#downloads
 
 This requires these two: http://www.numpy.org/, http://www.scipy.org/
  
 You can also run these commands if you an up-to-date version of Python2 or Python3.
 
pip install numpy

pip install scipy

pip install matplotlib

pip install scikit-learn


It's better to use Anaconda version if you want to eperiment with machine learning stuff because many of the libraries come installed with the distribution. 

The code presents the svm approach. For theory of SVM, go to references.
